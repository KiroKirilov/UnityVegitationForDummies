## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-06T19:32:34.523Z*

This task is of the utmost importance. I want you to perform an extensive research. I've used the
  @Assets/_Project/Scripts/VegetationBrush\ and it's related objects and have a lot of grass in the
  scene to thepoint it's starting to lag a bit. The problem is i really like how it looks. Your task
  is to look at the full grass sysstem we have with swaying in the wind and player rustling and
  everything and reserach and plan optimizations to make this less laggy while still keeping the
  dense grass look. The actual prefabs used you can see in the scene
  @Assets/_Project/Scenes/Intro.unity If there are better overall solutions that require a more
  major rework of the grass system i am down as long as it keeps the dense look with optimized
  performance. USE AS MANY RESOURCES AS YOU PLEASE< I DONT MIND PAYING EXTRA FOR THIS QUERY, reserach, look for info, analyze before making any changes.

Okay the problem is it looks like pure dogshit with now shadows adn the other change seemed to do nothing, we get like 2m verts and 700k tris with 20k shadow casters. Investigate further improvements that keep the look and feel. Look at your previuos plan for further ideas, also research online a way to achieve a very grassy 3d look that is more efficient if needed
