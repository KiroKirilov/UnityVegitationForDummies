## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-07T13:03:49.275Z*

I want you to look at the grass rendering we have - the shaders,baker,renderer. And then look at the custom editor we have tried to build for that to allow editing of baked grass instances. The problem is when i try to enable edit mode via the grass instance editor unity crashes. I've put logs in the @_dumps\ folder, read through them all, reserach online even to figure out the cause and propose a solution to this. You are free to redesign the grass instance editor if needed, main functionality is should support is showing baked grass (doesnt have to be all at a time) and allowing to select via moint and click a single grass object and edit it (move, rotate, scale, delete). USE AS MANY RESOURCES AS YOU PLEASE< I DONT MIND PAYING EXTRA FOR THIS QUERY, reserach, look for info, analyze before making any decisition
