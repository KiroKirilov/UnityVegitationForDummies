## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-06T16:15:50.022Z*

I want you to plan an expainsion of the grass-player rustle interation - i want to ahave the ability to setup a sound to play when that happens. I dont want you to create the source runtime, i want that to be setup in editor, but i will need you isntructions. I want you to research and think about what the sound should be, I mean should it be a single rustle or a long variaed rustle sound that loops and we can play longer, whatever would be the best sounding (i imagine the second variant but please explore options)
