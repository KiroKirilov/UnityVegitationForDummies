## Prompt 1 [VEG]

I want you to take a very deep look at the current grass baker and renderer and the shaders involded with indirect rendering and analyze the following issue - when i baked and setup the renderer - seeming all data is baked and in the SO (~11k items) but when actually rendering not all of it is there and it's placed wrong and some flowers are ther which arent in the regular gameobject setup and flwoers lose shape, color. Im not sure if the baking is too rudimentary or if the renddering is wrong but you need to analyze this and come up with a plan to upgrade the rendered and/or baking to keep the look the same. Look at the vegetation brush settings and how it places veg, specifically its randomization params to see what we need to keep in the bake and render later. !!THIS IS JUST A THEORY I HAVE, DO A PROPER INVETIGATION AND DONT TAKE MY WORD AS GOSPEL.
