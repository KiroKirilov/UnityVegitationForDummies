## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-06T19:32:11.608Z*

This task is of the utmost importance. I want you to perform an extensive research. I've used the @Assets/_Project/Scripts/VegetationBrush\ and it's related objects and have a lot of grass in the scene to thepoint it's starting to lag a bit. The problem is i really like how it looks. Your task is to look at the full grass sysstem we have with swaying in the wind and player rustling and everything and reserach and plan optimizations to make this less laggy while still keeping the dense grass look. The actual prefabs used you can see in the scene @Assets/_Project/Scenes/Intro.unity If there are better overall solutions that require a more major rework of the grass system i am down as long as it keeps the dense look with optimized performance
