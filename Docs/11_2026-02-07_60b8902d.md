## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-07T11:57:00.607Z*

This is an extremely complex task and required precision and dilligence. I want you to look at the entire grass system we have - bakign and rendering and everything related. Then i want you to come up with an easy, visual way for me to edit/remove single assets from the bake - the problem is some of them are placed a little outside the platform and i want o manualyl be able to adjust them. Ideally this will control as if they're game objects - i'd be able to click to select and then move/rotate/scale/delete them. Think hard cause the runtime redered objects arent actually there in the scene - we will either need to do this in play mode or have special way of rendering the grass even when not in play mode. USE AS MANY RESOURCES AS YOU PLEASE< I DONT MIND PAYING EXTRA FOR THIS QUERY, reserach, look for info, analyze before deciding on aything.
