i want you to create plan about implementing a simple vegetation brush -> it should support grass prefabs as inputs, also flowers. Each needs to have randomization settings, like rotation and scale, as well what are the chances to place a flower so it can be more grassy or more flowery. The brush should be usable on a mesh, not on terrain, ideally in the scene editor. When using the brush i want to see a circle on the ground where things will be placed. It needs to have configurable density and size and for now just make it circular. Before you begin - RESEARCH ONLINE on how to approach this correctly cause we need to base it on a solid baseline design to iterate properly on it. We don't need industrial grade implementations, just keep it simple for now

Rework the SO to be more user friendly - I want it to have seprate rass/flowers prefabs on purpose. I want global controls for grass/flowers isntead of having to manually setup each one. I also want you to put good defaults for both. By default all items in the two collection should have an evenly spread distribution, but allow for customization. The other things liek rotation, titlt, scale should also be global for both colelctions (grass/flowers) and i want good default there too.
