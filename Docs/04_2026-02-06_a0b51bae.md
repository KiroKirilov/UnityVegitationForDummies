## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-06T16:11:15.747Z*

I want you to plan an extension of the vegitation brush. Fist you are required to get extrememly well familiar with it. Then i want you to make it so it has two extra optional settings -> OnlyUpFace, meaning it should only draw on meshes' up side, my platforms have a bit of a slope on the side and the brush currently sometimes paints on it and it's annoying clean up. The other options is layer mask - i want you to make it so i can choose which layers it draws on. sometimes it spawns stuff on npcs and bushes. These two settigns should work together or separately with no issues and shoud integrate nicely in the current solution
