## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-07T15:29:22.188Z*

I want you to investigate in complete depth - the vegitation brush, the grass baker, renderer and isntance editor. Then i want you to plan the implementation of the following feature -> iwant the vegitation brush to be usable o nthe baked data directly similar to how editing it works via the editor - so in play mode i can turn on the brush and it can have a toggle/setup to put stuff in a baked data SO isntead of on the scene directly. Pay attention to how stuff is re-rendered and such cause this may cause a gpu usage spike and we dont want crashes

Now i want you to create a new folder and put a COPY of the entire veg system so i can use it a diff project. Includes brush, renderer, baking, editing, but not actual prefabs, jsut the code part required to setup veg in a new project. Just put it in a folder, dotn change the existing code AT ALL
