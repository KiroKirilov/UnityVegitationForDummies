## Prompt 1 [VEG]
*2026-02-07T14:15:50.929Z*

I want you to look at the entire grass instancing logic nad the grass instance editor tool. The tool now loads properly in play mode, i can select grass and can delete instance BUT moving, rotating and scaling dont work at all, i imagine becuase the grass object arent actual game objects. Iwant you to investigate i ndepth, RESEDARCH ONLINE IF NEEDED in depth and design a solution to thies. What I have in mind is when a grass is selected -> create a ghost gameobject copy of it that can be rotated/moved/scaled like normal and an apply button that takes the values from the ghost grass and updates the bake with it, only one ghost object would be active at a time, as they should be deleted when sswithcing to a diff grass. The ghostiness of it would allow for previeew of thechange too. DONT TAKE THIS AS GOSPEL THOUGH, IT'S JUST AN IDEA I HAD, IF THERE IS A BETTER SOLUTION IM ALL FOR IT. this needs quality research behind it. USE AS MANY RESOURCES AS YOU PLEASE< I DONT MIND PAYING EXTRA FOR THIS QUERY, reserach, look for info, analyze before making any decisions.

Okay that worked, there are still some issues though - main one is that i cant seem to click on some of the grass piece to select them. I imagine they are part of a more spread out mesh and one of their "growths" so to speak is outside the platform and it's impossible to try and find it just by clicking around, can you investigate that clicking on any part of the mesh/grass/flower/whatever results in it being selected and if that's already the case - ivnestigate what may be causing this

## Prompt 8 [VEG]
*2026-02-07T15:06:55.974Z*

okay worked, but now i want you to investigate this problem both ehre and online -> in dense areas of grass its almost impossible to pick the one i want. Is it possible to have the clickabble area be closer to the actual mesh isntead of justa  bounding box. If not think like a designer and propose solutions to get around this.
